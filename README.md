You need to get lesson 1 running if you wish to understand this lesson.

This program takes input from a push button on P1.1 and toggles the LED connected to P2.0.
This version uses interrupts to do so.

Simply copying the code from main.rs into your own project will not work. There is important settings in the Cargo.toml. See the comments in Cargo.toml and main.rs for details.
